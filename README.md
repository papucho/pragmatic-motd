# Pramgatic message of the day

---

This is a simple CLI that displays a random tip in the console.

These tip belong to the book [The Pragmatic Programmer (by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas)](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer).

If you're a programmer (or software engineer or whatever) you should read it. It's awesome.

## How to run

The idea of this package is to be used as a `motd`, showing a message every time you create a new bash session.

You can do that by adding this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
// Display a random tip from 'The Pragmatic Programmer'.

pragmatic-motd

```

And that's all. Every time you create a new shell session a random quote will be displayed.
